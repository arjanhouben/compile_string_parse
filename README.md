# compile_string_parse
playground to see if I could parse json at compile time

## Why?
Because programming puzzles are fun!

I learned some tricks along the way, so that's nice

## Is it really all compile time?

Yes! https://godbolt.org/z/zj4bqf

There is no parsing of floating point numbers and I am sure there are other things missing with regards to parsing JSON
